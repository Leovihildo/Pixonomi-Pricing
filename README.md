### Pixonomi Pricing Page (Old Version)

## Overview:
This project is a pricing page designed for Pixonomi, featuring five distinct plans tailored to different user needs. The page offers a dynamic and user-friendly experience with a slider that allows users to customize their plan based on their credit usage.

## Plans:
1. Basic Plan: Free entry-level plan with essential features.
2. PowerPixel Plan: Offers advanced features for more demanding users.
3. PowerPixel Plus Plan: Additional benefits for users with higher requirements.
4. PowerPixel Plus Growth Plan: Designed for growing businesses with expanding needs.
5. Enterprise Plan: Comprehensive plan for large-scale operations, requiring users to book a demo for custom pricing.

## Key Features:
- Dynamic Pricing Slider: Positioned above the plan cards, this slider allows users to adjust their credit usage, which dynamically updates the pricing for the PowerPixel, PowerPixel Plus, and PowerPixel Plus Growth plans. The Basic and Enterprise plans remain unaffected by the slider.
- Responsive Design: The page is fully responsive, ensuring that it displays and functions optimally across different devices and screen sizes.
- User-Centric Layout: The plans are presented in a clear and concise manner, allowing users to easily compare features and select the best option for their needs.

## Technologies Used:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
- Others: Bootstrap, ion.RangeSliderJS

## Purpose:
The pricing page was developed to provide a flexible and intuitive way for Pixonomi's users to understand and select the plan that best suits their needs, with the added convenience of a pricing slider for customized plans.
